  desc: Hey, I am Dimpy Chhabra, a prefinal year student at Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women pursuing Bachelors of Technology in Information Technology. I love to code and develop real-time solutions to problems.When I am not coding, I enjoy reading, outdoor activities, public speaking, group discussions and most passionately following news on modern physics and cosmology. Other than exploring new sciences & technologies and working on projects, I try my part to promote women who code. I am a fellow mentor at ACM-IGDTU and am presently leading a mentorship program with over 65 students.
